# Starter_App
creating a starter app with frond end and back end

The swift files are under folder Chatter.

The App is currently connected to my back-end server at:
142.93.65.251
To change back to the connection in the tutorial, use:
3.16.22.144 

In django_project folder, django_project/django_project/urls.py and django_project/chatter/views.py are customized. 

Enjoy!
